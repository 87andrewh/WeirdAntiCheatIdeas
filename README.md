# Weird Anti-Cheat Ideas
A place for collecting anti-cheat ideas that I find weird or compelling.  
Hopefully I don't include anything that will come back to bite.

### Detection:  
- Quantifying impact of cheaters. Just player perception? If players don't notice, is ther a probelem?  
- Quantifying types of cheaters, the amount of damage they do. 
- Is machine learning the end game? Or other automated systems? Manual banning seems like an ops nightmare.  
- Weird features:  
  - Quantify aim skill relative to other skills (movement, inventory management)   
  - Drastic changes in some skill  
  - Weird networking, changing IP, changing latency
  - Features that discourage blatant hacking  
  
### Prevention:  
- Occlusion culling / fog of war  
- Give up fighitng client-side code protection?  
  - What can you do against hardware access?  
  - How skilled are cheat developers?  
- Increasing cheater cost of rentry, higher level for comp, price tag, 2FA  
  - Sandbox highly skilled new accounts, or accounts with recently changed passwords or IP, or are behind a VPN 
  - Stricter identification requirements for top ~1% ranks  

### Deterence:  
- Give up on permabans? Isn't there always eventually a workaround?  
- False positive quantification, defining and constraining cost  
- Integrate with VAC  

### Behavioral:  
- Compensate players for running into cheaters, without making the system gameable  
- Rollback competitive game changes if a cheater is later detected  
- Incentivise players to help with crowdsourced detection  

### Industry Goals:
- Anti-cheat developer community of scale similar to anti-malware community? Journals? Conferences?  
- How to incentize people working at competing companies to contribute?
- Simple, open-source tools to help small devlopers protect themselves.  
- Incorperating ideas from many genres? FPS, MMO, RTS, MOBA.  
- Gaining knowledge from EAC and Battleye. Job opportunities?  
- Collaborating with former (or current) cheat creation researchers.  

### Economic:  
- Measuring elasticity of cheat demand. 
- Possible to undercut cheat providers? Or does supply just create more demand?  

### Developer Practices:  
- EAC dev reccomends to not announce ban waves (small numer looks lazy, big number normalizes cheating).  
  - Still give feedback through indivdual ban announcements like Battleye?  
- Don't interract with trolls on forums.  
- Communicate with commnunity in clearly designated cheat forum. Get player feedback, ideas, desires.  
- Act like a duck.  
- How transparent should you be about features? Should you be totally transparent if you can?  
- Stay safe
  - Don't be a target. Would someone be incentivized to harm you or your friends?  
  - Use good personal security practices.  
  
### Project management:  
- Ideal anti-cheat team composition. Size, skills?  
- Collaborating with security team?  
- How much labor to outsource to third parties. How deeply integrated should those systems be?  
- Beta deploy features? Or just internal testing to full deploy? 

### Career:
- Where to start working? Indie devs, studios, publishers, third party solutions, cheaters?
- How to decide between offers?
  - Potential to learn
  - Potential to make an impact
  - Potential to make connections
  - $

### Misc:  
- Trust factor depenidng on linked accounts. Integrate with Valve's trust factor.  
- Grouping cheaters together in games instead of banning.  
- Custom game modes with wallhacks and easy aim, maybe speed. Modes with assymetric player power.  
- Legally taking down cheat providers.  
- Mobile constriants?  
- Laying traps for cheat developers, bait or directed evolution.  
- Collaborating locally to secure different regions. Tencent for China.
