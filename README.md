# WeirdAntiCheatIdeas
A place for collecting anit-cheat ideas that I find weird or compelling. 

Detection:  
  Quantifying impact of cheaters. Just player perception? If players don't notice, is ther a probelem?  
  Quantifying types of cheaters, the amount of damage they do. 
  Is machine learning the end game? Or at least highly automated systems? Manual detection is a greusome treadmil.  
  Weird features:  
    Quantify aim skill relative to other skills (movement, inventory management)  
    Designing features that discourage blatant hacking  
  
Prevention:  
  Occlusion culling / fog of war  
  Give up fighitng client-side code protection?  
    What can you do against hardware access?  
    How skilled are cheat developers?  

Deterence:  
  Give up on permabans? Isn't there always eventually a workaround?  
  False positive quantification, defining and constraining cost  

Behavioral:  
  Incentivise players to help with crowdsourced detection  
  Increasing cheater cost of rentry, higher level for comp, price tag, 2FA  
     Sandbox highly skilled new accounts, or accounts with recently changed passwords or IP, or are behind a VPN  
  Compensate players for running into cheaters, without making the system gameable  

Industry Goals:
   Anti-cheat developer community of scale similar to anti-malware community? Journals? Conferences?  
   Incorperating ideas from many genres? FPS, MMO, RTS, MOBA.  
   Gaining knowledge from EAC and Battleye  
   Collaborating with former (or current) cheat creation researchers.  
   Anti-cheat team composition  

Economic:  
  Measuring elasticity of cheat demand. 
  Possible to undercut cheat providers? Or does supply just create more demand?  

Developer Practices:  
  EAC dev reccomends to not announce ban waves (small numer looks lazy, big number normalizes cheating).  
    Still give feedback through indivdual ban announcements like Battleye  
  Don't interract with trolls on forums.  
  Communicate with commnunity in clearly designated cheat forum. Get player feedback, ideas, desires.  
  Act like a duck.  
  How transparent should you be about features? Should you be totally transparent if you can?  
  
Project management:  
  Ideal anti-cheat team composition. Size, skills?  
  How much labor to outsource to third parties. How deeply integrated should those systems be?  

Misc:  
  Trust factor depenidng on linked accounts. Integrate with Valve's trust factor.  
  Grouping cheaters together in games instead of banning.  
  Custom game modes with wallhacks and easy aim, maybe speed. Modes with assymetric player power.  
  Legally taking down cheat providers.  
  Mobile constriants?  
  Laying traps for cheat developers, easy exploits as bait.
